<!-- Customize the broadcaster's broadcast panel with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. -->
<!-- The broadcast panel is the rectangular panel that appears below the chat in split mode and on the broadcaster page. In theater mode, the broadcast panel appears within the chat window. Broadcast Panel web components will expand on mouseover, allowing for the display of more content than the base broadcast panel dimensions. -->
